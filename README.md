 - - *Note: I used Ms SQL to do this exercise. I'm a non-specialist back-end developer, I have learned and worked with back-end positions but non-specialist, I'm a Front-end developer. And I hardly work with databases. So I used what I learned in school and search on the internet to do this exercise. So, maybe it is not perfect. *
